      "As many of us are probably already aware, there is a surprisingly simple \"secret\" to figuring out the chords for a popular song. Namely, there are four chords that comprise countless songs in pop music, as shown in the YouTube link above. Creating a tune, however, is only half the battle. Lyrics, some might argue, are just as important as the notes in songs. Considering the diversity of song lyrics, it might be harder to find trends, as one would have to look for similarities on a semantic basis. As an alternative, I took the lyrics from the ten most popular songs on the Billboard Hot 100 for 2014 and attempted to randomly generate lyrics from those."

There was an example in chapter 2 of the NTLK book, but following that code blindly will result in an infinite loop because of the way it only checks for the word with the highest probability and uses that as the next word. For example, \"'Bout that base 'Bout that base 'Bout that base...\" will repeat since \"base\" is most likely to be followed by \"'Bout\". While not as accurate, randomly picking a word that follows will help to avoid this trend. A more accurate way of accomplishing this would be to use the probabilities of each word rather than using random.choice(), which pretty much makes all the possible words have an equal probability of occurring next..."

While we have seemingly perfected the four chords that play in seemingly way too many songs, coming up with a coherent message to go along with the song does not seem nearly as simple. As much as I'd like to say that you can just call generate_song() and come up with a hit song instantly, it doesn't quite work that way. Granted, there are parts of these generated texts that sound like they could be straight out of some edgy song, like \"Boy, you go ahead and quit it You should\", but really, not enough of the lyrics make sense to warrant using any of these examples as a song. Perhaps with more tweaking, something more coherent may be a possibility..."
