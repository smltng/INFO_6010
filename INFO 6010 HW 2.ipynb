      "While the \"hidden goal\" of this assignment was to get used to handling APIs and scraping data, I figured I might as well try to have some fun. Originally, I had all these grand ideas for a great API to pull from and all the crazy analyses I'd run on datasets. Everything, of course, is not as easy as it seems, and I ended up stumped for a while. Some APIs didn't have data readily available that I hoped to pull. Others simply did not seem to help answer any questions I felt were interesting. On a whim, I turned to the New York Times API and decided to look up what they thought of President Obama since the point where he got elected."
